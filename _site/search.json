If the name of the site is not present on that first frame, the button appears to be blank (unless hovered). While that may be an intentional design choice on the part of the button’s creator, I’m mentioning it only to be helpful to button creators who may not be aware of how freezeframe and similar solutions render buttons when animations are turned off.\n\n\n\tThe simple way to see a button’s animation when animations are turned off is to hover your mouse over the button.\n\n\n\t-joe jenett\n\n\n(cross-posted to mastodon)\n",

It seems that browsers follow the height attribute and reduce the width accordingly. I came up with a solution that worked for me (adding a little style) - it may not be the ’best practice’ but I decided to share just in case others find it useful: \n\n\n\t&lt;img src=\"/images/IMAGENAME.EXTENSION\" alt=\"ALT TEXT\" width=\"88\" height=\"31\" style=\"min-width:88px;max-height:31px;\"&gt;\n\n\nUpdate 02/13/25: Thanks to Matthew for reminding that using a class name instead of inline styles is probably a better way. In fact, I did that today thanks to his feedback.\n\n\nI added class=\"button-fix\" to each of the img tags in question and the following to my stylesheet:\n\n\n.button-fix {\n &nbsp; min-width:88px;\n &nbsp; max-height:31px;\n}\n\nIt is a better way!\n\n(cross-posted to mastodon)\n",

I love the web!\n\n\nThank you Neocities community - I appreciate those following 𝗯𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘁𝗼𝘄𝗻.𝗻𝗲𝗼 and created a little section with your linked buttons on the main page (also at 𝗯𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘁𝗼𝘄𝗻.𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟮).\n\n\nMake it a great day and thanks for stopping by…\n\n\n\n",

The personal web is flourishing again and they’ve played a big part in its revival. I’m grateful.\n\n\nSo here I am y’all, happy to be a small part of this vibrant community.\n\n\nThough bulltown lives on my personal domain, we’ve been neighbors for a long time. Nice to meet ya!\n\n\n\n\n",
