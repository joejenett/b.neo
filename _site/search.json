In fact, I did that today thanks to his feedback.\n\n\nI added class=\"button-fix\" to each of the img tags in question and the following to my stylesheet:\n\n\n.button-fix {\n &nbsp; min-width:88px;\n &nbsp; max-height:31px;\n}\n\nIt is a better way!\n\n(cross-posted to mastodon)\n",

The personal web is flourishing again and they‚Äôve played a big part in its revival. I‚Äôm grateful.\n\n\nSo here I am y‚Äôall, happy to be a small part of this vibrant community.\n\n\nThough bulltown lives on my personal domain, we‚Äôve been neighbors for a long time. Nice to meet ya!\n\n\n\n\n",
