<p>Just a quick note to let you know I’ve been working on improving how the button walls render on mobile. Though most of the work is being done offline, both 𝗯𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘁𝗼𝘄𝗻.𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟮 and 𝗯𝘂𝗹𝗹𝘁𝗼𝘄𝗻.𝗻𝗲𝗼 may occasionally look a little funky as the project continues. Thx.

	Update 10/02/24: Now that mobile’s looking good, some other changes are underway - please stay tuned... 😎
