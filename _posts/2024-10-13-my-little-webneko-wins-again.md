My finicky friend WebNeko (up there in the left corner) doesnâ€™t always play well with other scripts. At the b22 site, I actually had rebuilt the music section to bring little neko back. Now, here on the neo site, I did away with the Zonelets script, not because I didn't like it, but because I was able to bring my little buddy back. Yay!
