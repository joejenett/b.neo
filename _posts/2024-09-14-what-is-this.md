	The idea to create <em>bulltown.neo</em> came to me recently as I explored a(nother) newly discovered Neocities site.
</p>
<p>
As a curator (of sorts) on the web since 1997, Neocities holds a special place in my heart. The personal web is flourishing again and they’ve played a big part in its revival. I’m grateful.
</p>
<p>
So here I am y’all, happy to be a small part of this vibrant community.
</p>
<p>
Though bulltown lives on my personal domain, we’ve been neighbors for a long time. Nice to meet ya!
